# IMPORTANT!!!  
The version of snake included here is the Windows version. It will not work on MacOS or GNU/Linux.  
chomp.wav needs to be downloaded as well and placed into the same directory as Snake_Win.py.  

To make the files compatible with Linux and MacOS the PlaySound() function from winsound needs to be replaced.
